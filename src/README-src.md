src directory
=============

this directory contains the manually maintained 
asciidoc source files
for the arc42 template.

It is ordered by language, where DE is currently the master.

Idea is to have the following:


     DE/asciidoc/plain
    .../......../plain-mit-hilfe 
    .../......../samples/...
    .../eap
     EN/asciidoc/
    .../eap


* asciidoc: hopefully we can generate everything else from this format :-)
* eap: a skeleton Enterprise-Architect (tm) model
