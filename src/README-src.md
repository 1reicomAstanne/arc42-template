src directory
=============

this directory contains the manually maintained source files
for the arc42 template.

It is ordered by language, where DE is currently the master.

Idea is to have the following:


     DE/asciidoc/
    .../eap
    .../docx
     EN/asciidoc/
    .../eap
    .../docx


* asciidoc: hopefully we can generate everything else from this format :-)
* eap: a skeleton Enterprise-Architect (tm) model
* docx: the current Microsoft-Word (tm) version. In the future, this format shall be generated from the asciidoc source.
