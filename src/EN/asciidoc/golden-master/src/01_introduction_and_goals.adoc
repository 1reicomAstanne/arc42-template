.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged â€¦

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
A list of the most important persons or organizations that are affected by or can contribute to the architecture.

.Motivation
If you do not know the persons participating in or concerned with the project you may get nasty surprises later in the development process. Should your project manager maintain this list, make sure that all the people influencing the architecture are part of it.

.Form
Simple table with role names, person names, their knowledge as pertaining to architecture, their availability, etc.
