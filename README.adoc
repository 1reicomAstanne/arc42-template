== arc42-template

arc42 - the template for software architecture documentation and communication

Initially created by Dr. Gernot Starke and Dr. Peter Hruschka (way back in 2005...),
free and open source.

== How to use this Project

This repository currently contains the "Golden Master" of the arc42 template in 
link:src/EN/asciidoc/golden-master/src[english] and link:src/DE/asciidoc/golden-master/src[german] 
and it contains gradle projects to convert the golden master into other formats. The repository includes
the gradle-wrapper - a script which will automatically install gradle for you if it is not already installed.

In order to create the other formats follow these steps:

* +gradlew createTemplatesFromGoldenMaster+

This will extract the "no help"-version from the golden master. You'll find those templates in +build\src_gen+.

Btw: gradle allows you to "shorten" the command - as long as gradle is still able to guess the command, 
anything goes :-). +gradlew createT+ is as valid as +gradlew cTFGM+.

* +gradle2 arc42+

This will create all other formats. They will be located directly in the +build+ directory. 
This is still work in progress. Some of the build steps need extra tools like pandoc installed, 
so it is likely that you encounter errors.

== Requirements
We collected the +arc42+ link:docs/arc42-requirements.adoc[requirements]
in its own document.



== Downloads
Please be patient - downloads will be available from here once
we establish the travis-based continous build system.
