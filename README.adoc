:version 7.0:

arc42 - the template for software architecture documentation and communication.
Initially created by Dr. Gernot Starke and Dr. Peter Hruschka (way back in 2005...),
free and open source.


**This repository contains the (AsciiDoc) source of the arc42 template.**


It is used to:

*  generate (by the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-generator[arc42-generator] project) the official download
formats (i.e. docx, markdown, docbook and others).
* maintain structure, content and help for the template
* keep non-asciidoc formats (like EAP).

In case you find issues within the template or its explanations,
this is the repo to fix and issue pull requests :-)
