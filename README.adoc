:version 8.0:
:downloads https://arc42.org/downloads/:

arc42 - the template for effective, practical and pragmatic software architecture
documentation and communication.

Initially created by Dr. Gernot Starke and Dr. Peter Hruschka (way back in 2005...),
free and open source.


This repository contains all downloadable versions plus the (AsciiDoc)
source of the arc42 template.


It is used to:

*  generate (by the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-generator[arc42-generator] project) the official download formats (i.e. docx, markdown, docbook and others).
* maintain structure, content and help for the template
* keep non-asciidoc formats (like Sparx(r) Enterprise-Architect(c) EAP).

In case you find issues within the template or its explanations, this is the repo to fix and issue pull requests :-)

Please refer to the https://arc42.org/download[official download page] for

== Build the HTML version

Within the 'build.gradle' script, you might replace the default language (EN) with your choice.
