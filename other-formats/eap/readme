= About the template
This template includes the complete arc42 structure, based on version 8.2 from January 2023. The template is provided as a QEA file, which is the new SQlite file format starting with Enterprise Architect 16. It uses only functions from the Professional Edition to support all editions of Enterprise Architect. If you only want to view a model, have a look at the EA Viewer which is offered free of charge and can be downloaded here: https://www.sparxsystems.eu/enterprise-architect/ea-lite-edition
The template implementation uses UML diagrams and text documents, where diagrams are not suitable. Some parts, like the glossary and risks use extended UML.

= How to use
1. Download the ZIP file in the language of your choice (DE or EN).
2. Copy the template to your target location and rename it.
3. Open the file.
4. Edit all the files according to your needs. You will find the official arc42 explanation provided as notes directly in the corresponding diagrams. Where needed, I added some additional help.
5. You can delete the "Info" package if you want. It only contains meta information to the arc42 template.
